Dacne is a work in progress highly reactive data access layer skeleton for .NET Standard projects. It aims to provide the 'glue' between your custom data retreival, parsing, and caching components. Additionally, its public API follows the familiar Git concepts and nomenclature of "commit", "push", and "pull" (in the future).

The name Dacne comes approximately from "Data Access for .Net". However, according to Urban Dictionary it's appropriately synonymous to the feeling after spending the night before release replacing your falling apart data access code with a Dacne based implementation:

> Dance acne. 
> The gross feeling you experience when you are at an intense party and you dance for sooo long that you sweat a lot and feel like the next day you will break out in acne. It is **not a good feeling but the sign of a great night out** / party.
